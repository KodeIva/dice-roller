 Roll the Dices game is played by two participants. On every button click the app generates random number for Player1 and Player2,based on that the player with the bigger number wins a point. The dices can be rolled 10 times, after the last roll the player with the most points wins the game. There is also a 'restart game' button which deletes the results and the game available for play.
